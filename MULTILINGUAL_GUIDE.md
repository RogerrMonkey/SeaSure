- 🇮🇳 Marathi (मराठी)
- 🇮🇳 Tamil (தமிழ்)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Package Installation
```bash
npm install i18next react-i18next react-native-localize
```

### 2. File Structure
```
i18n/
├── index.ts              # Main i18n configuration
└── locales/
    ├── en.json          # English translations
    ├── hi.json          # Hindi translations  
    ├── mr.json          # Marathi translations
    └── ta.json          # Tamil translations
```

### 3. Key Features
- **Automatic Language Detection**: Detects device language and falls back to English
- **Persistent Language Storage**: Remembers user's language choice using AsyncStorage
- **Language Selector Component**: Easy switching between languages in settings
- **Fishing-Specific Terminology**: Includes fish species names and maritime terms
- **Real-time Language Switch**: Changes apply immediately without app restart

### 4. Translation Categories

#### Navigation
- Map, Weather, Logbook, Alerts, Trip Planner, Settings, Help, Profile

#### Weather Terms
- Wind Speed, Wave Height, Visibility, Temperature, Fishing Conditions

#### Logbook Terms
- Fish Species, Weight, Quantity, Location, Catch History, Log Catch

#### Fish Species (18 species)
- Pomfret, Kingfish, Tuna, Mackerel, Sardine, Hilsa, Prawns, etc.
- Includes both marine and freshwater species common in Indian waters

#### Trip Planning
- Waypoints, Route Optimization, Distance, Fuel Cost, AI Recommendations

### 5. Usage in Components

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'

function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation()
  
  return (
    <Text>{t('logbook.title')}</Text>  // "Fishing Logbook"
  )
}
```

### 6. Language Selector Integration

```tsx
import LanguageSelector from '../components/LanguageSelector'

// In Settings Screen
<LanguageSelector />
```

### 7. Localized Fish Species

```tsx
// Dynamic fish species based on current language
const getFishSpecies = (t: any) => [
  { id: 'pomfret', name: t('fish_species.pomfret'), category: 'Marine', emoji: '🐟' },
  // ... more species
]

// Usage in component
const { t } = useTranslation()
const FISH_SPECIES = getFishSpecies(t)
```

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Package installation and configuration
- Translation files for all 4 languages
- Language detection and persistence
- Core screen translations (LogbookScreen, Navigation)
- Language selector component
- Integration with SettingsScreen

🔄 **Partially Implemented**:
- LogbookScreen fully translated
- Navigation tabs translated
- Core fish species translated

📋 **Next Steps**:
- Translate remaining screens (WeatherScreen, TripPlannerScreen, AlertsScreen, MapScreen)
- Add more fishing terminology and regional terms
- Test with fishermen for accuracy and usefulness
- Add voice pronunciation guides for key terms

## Benefits for Fishermen

1. **Accessibility**: Removes language barriers for non-English speaking fishermen
2. **Regional Relevance**: Uses local fish names and terminology

4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respects linguistic diversity of Indian fishing communities
5. **Improved Safety**: Critical alerts and warnings in native languages

## Technical Benefits

1. **Scalable**: Easy to add new languages
2. **Maintainable**: Centralized translation management
3. **Performance**: Lazy loading of translation resources
4. **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection
5. **Device Integration**: Respects device language preferences

## Translation Quality

All translations include:
- **Common fishing terms** in regional languages
